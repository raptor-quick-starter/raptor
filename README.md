# Prerequisite

1) Java 8
2) maven
3) IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse)
4) Webdriver(Mac/Windows/Linux)

Steps to use **raptor-quick-starter**

1) Clone https://github.com/raptor-quick-starter/raptor.git
2) Download selenium webdriver for the OS and browser (Chrome in this case) and keep it in "src/test/resources/drivers/" directory
3) Add/Update in application-test.properties file. Varaible chromeDriverPath =src/test/resources/drivers/chromedriver5 (.exe in case of windows)
4) Would like to run on selenium grid? Add/Update two variable 
app.isGridDisabled=false
app.gridNodeurl=https://Abc@seleniumgrid.net:443/wd/hub
5) Configure a job in jenkins for running this continously.

# raptor-quick-starter

An end-to-end test is a test that exercises an aspect of the system within the context of the system as a whole.

As an engineer, a product manager, a development lead, I would always want every critical aspect of the system to be tested as part of an end-to-end test. I just wouldn't live without this. This test not only verifies that the feature works, but it also verifies that it works under typical operational conditions. The end-to-end test is essential. I want to know that the system I'm delivering meets the requirements and will continue to meet the requirements as the system evolves in the future.

In the Testing Trophy, there are 4 types of tests.

End to End: A helper robot that behaves like a user to click around the app and verify that it functions correctly. Sometimes called "functional testing" or e2e.
Integration: Verify that several units work together in harmony.
Unit: Verify that individual, isolated parts work as expected.
Static: Catch typos and type errors as you write the code.

The biggest challenge so far is writing an E2E test for custom webcompoents (Polymer, Lit-html) having shadow DOM.

**Raptor-tests** has capability to easily test webcomponents just by configuring few steps in a test script.

End to end test cases are nothing but a journey of login, few clicks, some inputs, navigations, some expected values and finally logout.

One sample test script of Raptor

{
  "testCaseConfig": {
    "testName": "Test Mri scan",
    "proxy": false,
    "browser": "Chrome"
  },
  "testSteps": [
    {
      "stepName": "navigate to url",
      "action": "navigate",
      "url": "https://www.alodokter.com/"
    },
    {
      "stepName": "click Cari Dokter",
      "action": "click",
      "locator": "anchorLocator"
    },
    {
      "stepName": "click mri scan",
      "action": "click",
      "locator": "mriScan"
    },
    {
      "stepName": "click Doktor",
      "action": "click",
      "locator": "document.querySelector(\"#elCardList > slider-tab-menu\").shadowRoot.querySelector(\"#dokter\")"
    },
    {
      "stepName": "input value",
      "action": "input",
      "locator": "document.querySelector(\"#filterProcedure\").shadowRoot.querySelector(\"#inputFilter\")",
      "inputValue": "Mri"
    }
  ]
}


***** Detailed explanation of all the fields in test json scripts

1) **stepName**	Any string that will clearly explain the step which is currently being executed	
2	**action**	navigate, click, scroll, clickByText, input, sendKeys, expect	
3)	**time**	1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, Any value in milliseconds that is required to wait for next action before current action	
4)	**locator**	
document.querySelector("#screen-state").shadowRoot.querySelector("#form > form > button"),
login.submit.button

5)	**optionalLocator**	
document.querySelector("#screen-state").shadowRoot.querySelector("#form > form > button"),
login.submit.button
OptionalLocator is very useful when we are not sure of next possible button out two possibilities. One may come or second may come still test should pass

eg: while doing an action we may get one screen or we may get another screen. so it will be able to handle this scenario,

6)	**url**	https://www.abc.com/,
7)	**elementTextToFind**	"Mri Doctor" , Any text that we want to check if exist (with action clickByText) and click	
8)	**value**	2000,- 2000 (with action scroll),	
9)	**inputValue**	"Any String" (with action input),	
10	**optionalStep**	true, false, empty	
optionalStep is very useful when we are not sure if we will get that screen altogether or not, eg :

11	**expectedText**	"Doctor" Any text that we want to check if exist or not	
12	**sendKeys**
"Any value"	send keys is very helpful when we want to trigger on-blur option after entering values so that a disabled button will get enable before clicking it

Raptor can also be extended to selenium grid and Jenkins to trigger it via Job and send notification on success/failures :

Steps to add Selenium grid :

1) add these configurations to application.properties if you need to update them

app.isGridDisabled=true/false

app.gridNodeurl=https://{yourteamname}:{yourteamtoken}@seleniumgrid.abc.def:{port}/wd/hub

app.baseUrl=https://www.abc.com/

app.proxyUrl=http://proxy.abc.def.net:{port}

app.relativeTestscriptPath=src/test/resources/test-scripts/

app.relativescriptfailureScreenPath=target/surefire-reports/screenshot/error-

quitBrowserAfterTest=true

screenShotOnSuccess=false

app.defaulActionTime = 0

app.defaultWaitForOptionalSteps = 10

app.defaultTimeOut = 20

app.defaultBrowser = Chrome

app.browserVesrion = 85

chromeDriverPath =src/test/resources/drivers/chromedriver5

edgeDriverPath =
ieDriverPath =
